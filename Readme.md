About Dataset
Contents
This dataset contains 2 tables, in CSV format:

The Customer Churn table contains information on all 7,043 customers from a Telecommunications company in California in Q2 2022
Each record represents one customer, and contains details about their demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned), and more!
The Zip Code Population table contains complimentary information on the estimated populations for the California zip codes in the Customer Churn table
Collection Methodology
The public dataset is completely available on the Maven Analytics website platform where it stores and consolidates all available datasets for analysis in the Data Playground.

My Inspiration
Complete details were also provided about the challege in the link if you are interested. The purpose of uploading here is to conduct exploratory data analysis about the dataset beforehand with the use of Pandas and data visualization libraries in order to have a comprehensive review on key statistics and the pain points that I need to address, and finally portray all my findings and insights as reference to creating my BI report (Power BI, Tableau, etc.) in the form of a single page visualization.
